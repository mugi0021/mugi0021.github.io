        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Romeo, and I’m from Rwanda. I’m studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College.<br> In my program, I learn how to create things like websites and other media. I really enjoy working with technology and art,<br> and I’m excited to keep learning more about design and digital media.</p>
                
                <p>In my free time, I love listening to music because it helps me relax. I also like playing basketball, which is fun and keeps me active.<br> During the winter, I enjoy skiing because it’s a great way to spend time outdoors and try something a bit challenging.</p>
